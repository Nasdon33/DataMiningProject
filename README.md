# DataMiningProject
Project for the course of Data Mining / Big Data made with Andrea Ambrosi.

This project is divided in two part: the first one where we were asked to generate a dataset according to some constraints in order to generate pattern into the data. The second part was intended to be a data mining analysis that aim at discovering the patterns generated in the first part.

We produced a report on both the dataset generation and the pattern mining that are available in PDF files respectively in /BD_REPORT and /DM_REPORT.
